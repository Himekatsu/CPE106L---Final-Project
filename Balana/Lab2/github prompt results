# To create a Python program that allows users to navigate the lines of a text file, follow these steps:

# 1. **Prompt the user for a file name** and open the file.
# 2. **Read all lines** from the file into a list.
# 3. **Display one line at a time** and provide options to go to the next, previous, or a specific line.
# 4. **Loop** until the user chooses to exit.

# Hereâ€™s a simple outline to get you started:

# python

filename = input("Enter the filename: ")
try:
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
    exit()

current = 0
while True:
    print(f"\nLine {current + 1}: {lines[current].rstrip()}")
    print("Options: [N]ext, [P]revious, [G]o to line, [Q]uit")
    choice = input("Choose an option: ").strip().lower()

    if choice == 'n':
        if current < len(lines) - 1:
            current += 1
        else:
            print("Already at the last line.")
    elif choice == 'p':
        if current > 0:
            current -= 1
        else:
            print("Already at the first line.")
    elif choice == 'g':
        line_num = int(input("Enter line number: ")) - 1
        if 0 <= line_num < len(lines):
            current = line_num
        else:
            print("Invalid line number.")
    elif choice == 'q':
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid option.")

# You can expand this with error handling and more features as needed.
